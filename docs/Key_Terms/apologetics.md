# Apologetics

1. Apologia (ap-ol-og-ee'-ah) can be translated to both "*a verbal defense*" or "*a reasoned statement or arguement*". - [Strong's G627](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g627/esv/mgnt/0-1/)

???+ quote "Scripture Reference | 1 Peter 3:15"
    but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, **always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you**; yet do it with gentleness and respect,

    [1 Peter 3:15 ESV](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1PE.3.15)
