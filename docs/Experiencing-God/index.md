## 7 Realities of God
1. God is **always at work** *around you*.
2. God **pursues a continuing love relationship with you** that is *real* and *personal*.
3. God **invites** you to become involved with *Him in His work*.
4. God **speaks by the Holy Spirit** through the *Bible, prayer, circumstances, and the church* to reveal Himself, His purposes, and His ways.
5. God's *invitation* for you to work with Him always leads you to a **crisis of belief that requires faith and action**.
6. You must make **major adjustments** in your life to join God in what He is doing.
7. You **come to know God by experience** as you *obey Him*, and He accomplishes His work through you.
