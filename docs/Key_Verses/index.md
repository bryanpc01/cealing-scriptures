## Workout Your Salvation
!!! quote "Philipians 2:12-17 (CSB)"
    ^12^Therefore, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, so now, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, **work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.** ^13^For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose. ^14^Do everything without grumbling and arguing, ^15^so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God who are faultless in a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world, ^16^by holding firm to the word of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I didn’t run or labor for nothing. ^17^But even if I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrificial service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.

## Love One Another
!!! quote "1 John 3:11-24 (CSB)"
    ^11^For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: **We should love one another,** ^12^unlike Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.
    ^13^Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. ^14^We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. ^15^Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. ^16^This is how we have come to know love: He laid down his life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. ^17^If anyone has this world’s goods and sees a fellow believer in need but withholds compassion from him—how does God’s love reside in him? ^18^Little children, let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth.
    ^19^This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and will reassure our hearts before him ^20^whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things.
    ^21^Dear friends, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have confidence before God ^22^and receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight. ^23^Now this is his command: that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another as he commanded us. ^24^The one who keeps his commands remains in him, and he in him. And the way we know that he remains in us is from the Spirit he has given us.

    [1 John 3:11-24 (CSB)](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/1jn.3.11-24)

## God is Love
!!! quote "1 John 4:7-21 (CSB)"
    ^7^Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. ^8^The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. ^9^God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. ^10^Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice, for our sins. ^11^Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another. ^12^No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is made complete in us. ^13^This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. ^14^And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as the world’s Savior. ^15^Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God—God remains in him and he in God. ^16^And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us.
    **God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.** ^17^In this, love is made complete with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as he is, so also are we in this world. ^18^There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears is not complete in love. ^19^We love because he first loved us. ^20^If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. ^21^And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.

## Each Day Has Enough Trouble of Its Own
!!! quote "Matthew 6:25-34 (CSB)"
    ^25^“Therefore I tell you: Don’t worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothing? ^26^Consider the birds of the sky: They don’t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they? ^27^Can any of you add one moment to his life span by worrying? ^28^And why do you worry about clothes? Observe how the wildflowers of the field grow: They don’t labor or spin thread. ^29^Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these. ^30^If that’s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won’t he do much more for you—you of little faith? ^31^So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ ^32^For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. ^33^But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. ^34^Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

## Speech Seasoned with Salt
!!! quote "Colossians 4:2-6 (CSB)"
    ^2^Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving. ^3^At the same time, pray also for us that God may open a door to us for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains, ^4^so that I may make it known as I should. ^5^Act wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time. ^6^Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person.

    [Colossians 4:2-6 (CSB)](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/col.4.2-6)

## The Lord is My Light and My Salvation
!!! quote "Psalms 27 (CSB)"
    ^1^The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom should I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom should I be afraid? ^2^When evildoers came against me to devour my flesh — my foes and my enemies — they stumbled and fell. ^3^Though an army deploys against me, my heart will not be afraid; though a war breaks out against me, I will still be confident.

    ^4^I have asked one thing from the Lord; it is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the Lord and seeking him in his temple. ^5^For he will conceal me in his shelter in the day of adversity; he will hide me under the cover of his tent; he will set me high on a rock. ^6^Then my head will be high above my enemies around me; I will offer sacrifices in his tent with shouts of joy. I will sing and make music to the Lord.

    ^7^Lord, hear my voice when I call; be gracious to me and answer me. ^8^My heart says this about you: “Seek his face.” Lord, I will seek your face. ^9^Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or abandon me, God of my salvation. ^10^Even if my father and mother abandon me, the Lord cares for me.

    ^11^Because of my adversaries, show me your way, Lord, and lead me on a level path. ^12^Do not give me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing violence.

    ^13^I am certain that I will see the Lord’s goodness in the land of the living. ^14^Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart be courageous. Wait for the Lord.

## Death to Life
!!! quote "Ephesians 2 (CSB)"
    ^1^And you were dead in your trespasses and sins ^2^in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. ^3^We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. ^4^But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, ^5^made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace! ^6^He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, ^7^so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. ^8^For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—^9^not from works, so that no one can boast. ^10^For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

    ^11^So, then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh—called “the uncircumcised” by those called “the circumcised,” which is done in the flesh by human hands. ^12^At that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world. ^13^But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. ^14^For he is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In his flesh, ^15^he made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, so that he might create in himself one new man from the two, resulting in peace. ^16^He did this so that he might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross by which he put the hostility to death. ^17^He came and proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. ^18^For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. ^19^So, then, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household, ^20^built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. ^21^In him the whole building, being put together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. ^22^In him you are also being built together for God’s dwelling in the Spirit.

        ^7^Do not have other gods besides me.

        ^8^Do not make an idol for yourself, in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth. ^9^Do not bow in worship to them, and do not serve them, because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, ^10^but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commands.

        ^11^Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God, because the Lord will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses his name.

        ^12^Be careful to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy as the Lord your God has commanded you. ^13^You are to labor six days and do all your work, ^14^but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Do not do any work—you, your son or daughter, your male or fermale slave, your ox or donkey, any of your livestock, or the resident alien who lives within your city gates, so that your male and female slaves may rest as you do.

        ^15^Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.

### Consequence of Sin

        ^1^Therefore, every one of you who judges is without excuse. For when you judge another, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things. ^2^Now we know that God’s judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth. ^3^Do you think—anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same—that you will escape God’s judgment? ^4^Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? ^5^Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed. ^6^**He will repay each one according to his works:** ^7^eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality; ^8^but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness.

        ^15^What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not! ^16^Don’t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of that one you obey—either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness? ^17^But thank God that, although you used to which to sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were transferred to, ^18^and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. ^19^I am using a human analogy because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you offered the parts of yourselves as slaves to impurity, and to greater and greater lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness, which results in sanctification. ^20^For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness. ^21^So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. ^22^But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life! ^23^For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
