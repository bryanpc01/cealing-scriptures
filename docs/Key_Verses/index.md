For just as you offered the parts of yourselves as slaves to impurity, and to greater and greater lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness, which results in sanctification. ^20^For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness. ^21^So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. ^22^But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life! ^23^For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

You are saved by grace!
